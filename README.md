# Randomized_Optimization

This is a case study i done in 2022 Fall for Gatech CS7641 Machine Learning Course for Common Randomized Optimization Technique Used in ML model Training.

What is in it:

-Three classifical optimization problem: 
N-Queen, Traveling Sale Man, Max-K Color 
+ Neuron Network Training Optimization Problem

-Four RO algo:
-Random Hill Climing (RHC)
-Simulated Annealing (SA)
-Genetic Algorithm (GA)
-MIMIC (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/1996/hash/4c22bd444899d3b6047a10b20a2f26db-Abstract.html)

RO.ipynb: Optimization Problem setup and experiment code. It require Numpy, Pandas, Openai Gym 26.2, Hiive fork of PyMDPtoolbox(https://github.com/hiive/hiivemdptoolbox/releases) to run.

RO_report.pdf: -The actual case study report.
This is a two part report: 1) RO algos' performance on three classifical problem. 2) RO algos applied to a NN's hyperparameter tuning.
